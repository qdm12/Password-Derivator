[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/qdm12/Password-Derivator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/qdm12/Password-Derivator)

## Setup

**Make sure you use Python 3.7.x (32bit) or Python 2.7.x** and PIP

### Command line

1. Install necessary packages

    ```bash
    # Python 3
    pip3 install argon2_cffi qrcode pyperclip
    # Python 2
    pip install argon2_cffi pysha3 qrcode pyperclip
    ```

1. Launch the main script *main.py*. The options are:
    - `python main.py` will open the user interface (see below)
    - `python main.py #setup` will generate the master digest file deterministically from your master password and birth date
    - `python main.py facebook` will generate a deterministic password for **facebook** with a length of 24 characters
    - `python main.py facebook short` will generate a deterministic password for **facebook** with a length of 8 characters

### User interface

1. Install necessary packages
        
    ```bash
    # Python 3
    pip3 install argon2_cffi kivy kivy.deps.sdl2 kivy.deps.glew
    # Python 2
    pip install argon2_cffi kivy kivy.deps.sdl2 kivy.deps.glew
    ```

1. Launch the user interface with

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    
### Development

To run tests and develop the code, install the following:

```bash
# Python 3
pip3 install argon2_cffi qrcode pyperclip argon2_cffi kivy kivy.deps.sdl2 kivy.deps.glew nose rednose coverage coveralls
# Python 2
pip install argon2_cffi pysha3 qrcode pyperclip argon2_cffi kivy kivy.deps.sdl2 kivy.deps.glew nose rednose coverage coveralls mock
```

## Why ?

- Not remembering passwords
- Resistant to loss
- Resistant to bruteforce attacks
    - Botnets
    - Cloud computing and GPUs
    - ASICs miners
- Resistant to rainbow attacks
- Hacking attacks
    - Website hacked
    - HTTP sniffing
    - HTTPS and NSA backdoors at certificate authorities issuing your keys
- Your master password can't be found at all
- Your passwords are vulnerable if:
    1. The attacker knows you are using this program
    2. The attacker has your
        - Your birthdate AND your master password, or
        - Your master password digest file
- If you carry this program on a USB drive, be careful not to lose it !!

## To do

- Replace '/' in path with sys.sep
- Build it as executable for
    - [Windows](https://kivy.org/docs/guide/packaging-windows.html) and make it USB portable
    - [Android](https://kivy.org/docs/guide/packaging-android.html)
    - [iOS](https://kivy.org/docs/guide/packaging-ios.html)
    - [Mac](https://kivy.org/docs/guide/packaging-osx.html)
    - [Ubuntu](http://bitstream.io/packaging-and-distributing-a-kivy-application-on-linux.html)
- Docstring with Sphinx
- Finish User interface with [Kivy](https://kivy.org)
    - Colors and better experience
    - Add settings, tools
- Use Android fingerprint as PIN code replacement
- Make password robustness check better
    - Add other dictionaries
    - Check for birthdates in password
    - Check for common names of individuals (i.e. Trump)
    - Check for common names of places (i.e. Paris)
- Write some C code binding to Python to securely erase memory

## Done

- Write/Read of master password digest
- Recovery procedure if the master password digest file is lost
- Password generated matches all website requirements (hopefully)
- Unique password generated for each website
- Argon2ID
- Unit tests for robustness.py
- Robustness of password is calculated and transparent
- basic UI
- Uses SHA3
- Unit tests with coveralls and Travis CI

## To do eventually

- SSH keys generation from file
- See the list of websites you generated a password for
- AES encryption of files/directories
- Optional PIN code to have a few days of delay to change all passwords and against stupid people
- Shamir Secret sharing 
- Show robustness of password: # of words, # of letters, # of digits etc.

## What does it do, SIMPLIFIED

1. You input your *password* and *birthdate* **once** to generate the file `MasterPasswordDigest.txt`
   - It is impossible to deduce your *password* or *birthdate* from this file
   - This file should be kept safe
2. Every time you login **or** signup on a website, use the program to generate **another password** by entering the **website name**
   - This password is **always** the same for the same (*password*, *birthdate*, *website*) combination
   - It is impossible to deduce the `MasterPasswordDigest.txt` file **or** the website name from this password
   - This password matches all website's passwords requirements, including at least:
      - 1 lowercase letter
      - 1 uppercase letter
      - 1 digit
      - 1 symbol
      - Equal to 30 characters in length
      - No common words our famous names
	     
## What does it do, LESS SIMPLIFIED

1. The first part of the program stores the *nth* **argon2id** hash digest of your **master password** in a *file* (that should thus be **kept safe** !)
   - *nth* is derived from your birth date
   - This allows you to restore the file from your master password and birth date
   - This should only be ran once when you start using the program, for ease of use
   - We use *argon2id* to avoid botnet / cloud computing / ASICs - based attacks
      - If we would use SHA256, Bitcoin miners may [break it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ilx9f/could_bitcoin_be_turned_into_the_worlds_largest/#bottom-comments)
      - Even memory-hard hash algorithms such as Scrypt have now ASICs or can be bruteforced with GPUs
2. The second part of the program prompts you every time for the *website/company name* to generate a password deterministically.
   - This allows you to use this program to generate your password for signup **AND** for login
   - This also uses *argon2id* for better security
3. The generation of the password works as follows:
   - The master password digest is read from your file and concatenated with the website name
   - This is then hashed with *argon2id*
   - An *offset* is set to be equal to the integer value of this digest
   - Only the first 30 characters of this digest are taken, to keep under the password length limit of certain websites
   - For each character of the previously derived hexadecimal digest:
      1. The character is converted to an integer (with *ASCII*)
	  2. The *offset* is added to the character's value
	  3. The result is **MOD 127** so that it will be less than 127 (to avoid non-allowed characters of the ASCII table)
	  4. 2 and 3 are performed again if the result is less than 33 (again, to avoid non-allowed characters)
	  5. The character is replaced by the character corresponding to the value previously calculated. This overall gives a more complex password, if the attacker does not know you used this program.
   - We choose 4 unique indexes in the string of characters to change in the current 30 characters long password
      1. A list of indexes is created and empty.
	  2. The initial index is set to 1
	  3. The following is executed 4 times:
	    1. The index is set to itself times the  *offset* and **MOD 30**
	    2. If the index is in the list of indexes already, 3 is performed again
	    3. The index is added to the list of indexes
   - Finally, for each of these 4 indexes:
      - The character in the password at the first index is ensured to be a digit
	  - The character in the password at the second index is ensured to be a lowercase letter
	  - The character in the password at the third index is ensured to be an uppercase letter
	  - The character in the password at the fourth index is ensured to be a symbol (not any ASCII number though)
4. The password is then shown to the user.

## Why ?

- Always **match password requirements** for websites
- If a website not using password hashing is hacked, the attacker will be limited to this website
- You can re-use this program for all websites, especially if the attacker does not know you use this program (most likely)
- **As long as the attacker does not know you use this program**:
  - Your password is very strong and unbreakable if the attacker attacks a website
  - Plaintext communication (over HTTP) of your password won't reveal any information about your master password or password generation
  - NSA sniffing on HTTPS providers will also not learn any information regarding your master password or password generation
- **If an attacker only knows you use this program** AND has one (or more) of your generated password(s)
  - You are safe depending on your master password. This information is given when running *firstrun.py*.
    For example, the master password **abc12$** is safe for 1253600 years (with a single machine attacking)
- **If an attacker knows you use this program** AND **has your MasterPasswordDigest**:
  - You are safe depending on your master password. This information is given when running *firstrun.py*.
    For example, the master password **abc12$** is safe for 1044700 years (with a single machine attacking)
